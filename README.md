# Full Stack Capstone Project

## Full Stack Capstone

HeroKu URl: https://cap2m.herokuapp.com/
Local URl : http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## Motivation for project

My motivation for this project is to graduate from Udacity with FANS.

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

## Running local development

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

## Running via HeroKu

is running via HeroKu url below:

HeroKu URl: https://cap2m.herokuapp.com/

## API Reference

### Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```bash
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 405,
    "message": "Method Not Allowed here :("
}
```

The API will return three error types when requests fail:

- 405: Method Not Allowed here :(
- 404: resource not found
- 422: unprocessable
- 500: Internal Server Error
- AuthError
